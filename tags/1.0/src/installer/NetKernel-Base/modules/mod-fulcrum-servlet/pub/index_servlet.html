       successfully Setup NetKernel with your Servlet Engine. Congratulations!

       <p>If you are the administrator you may access the <a
        href="http://localhost:1060/">backend fulcrum</a> for administration
        and documentation. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Note:</b>  If you see Exceptions when accessing the backend system
        it is because your servlet engine does not have the XML libraries (found in 
		lib/endorsed/ below the NetKernel install directory) in its endorsed classpath.
		For more info boot in standalone mode and look at this
