Javadoc was generated by the following command line:

$ javadoc -d javadoc -sourcepath mod-purl-admin/modules/mod-purl-admin/
-group "PURL Modules for 1060 NetKernel" "org.purl.*" -group "1060
NetKernel" "org.ten60.*:com.ten60.*" @packages @sourcefiles

Where 'packages' was a file containing a list of all 1060 NetKernel and
PURL Module package names and 'sourcefiles' was a file containing a list
of all Java source files. The latter was generated by the command line:

$ find . -name '*.java' > sourcefiles

The file 'packages' should be located in the same directory as this
file.
