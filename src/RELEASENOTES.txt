This file contains release notes for the PURL server.

------------------------- 
| Version 1.6.2 Changes |
-------------------------
Provides a single file (simplepurl.html) to facilitate the creation of 
simple (302) PURLs via a Javascript bookmarklet.  The bookmarklet itself
is accessible from:
  http://purlz.org/project/purl/documentation/


----------------------------- 
| Version 1.6-1.6.1 Changes |
-----------------------------

Major changes:
* Feature request http://purlz.org/project/purl/development/ticket/1073
  partially addressed.  Three new variations on partial-redirect PURLs
  are introduced to support various use cases.  Directions for use and
  a full desription of functionality are available in the help file.

Minor:
* URLs with non-standard characters (e.g. '/dc/elements/1.1/\">') should
  now redirect instead of returning a 500-series error code.  URLs
  including the '$' character will still fail.
* Repaired a bug where a 500 status is being returned for all PURLs with
  a '/docs/' path segment.
* Further fixes for resolution of URL's with invalid characters, fix for database timestamp 
  sync issue, suppression of search indexer log messages


Outstanding:
* This release (and previous releases) do not support input of Unicode
characters.

------------------------- 
| Version 1.5 Bug Fixes |
-------------------------

Version 1.5 of the PURL server subtly changes the relationship between
PURLs and domains to better support legacy PURLs.  Domains may now be
created that contain PURLs of the same name (that is, a PURL with a name
cooresponding to an empty string or a '/' character).

PURLs may now be created with names that differ only by a trailing '/'
(e.g. /net/foo and /net/foo/).


These features were added in support legacy PURL migration.  Naming
new PURLs with these patterns is not encouraged.

No reported bugs were addressed in this release.  However, some
additional URL-encoding of form elements was added to the Web user
interface to better support special characters.

FIXED:
#1062
